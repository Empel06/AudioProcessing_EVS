# Project Assignments for Pynq Boards

## Project Assignment 1: Data over Audio using DTMF tones

### Project Description:
In this project, you will use two Pynq boards to communicate with each other using DTMF (Dual-tone Multi-frequency) encoding. The data must be transmitted via a serial communication line and correctly decoded and detected by the receiving board.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Sine Wave Generation  
- DTMF Generation  
- DTMF Detection  
- Serial Communication for transmitting and receiving data  

### Requirements:
- Two Pynq boards  
- Serial communication interface  
- Software for DTMF generation and detection  

### Submission:
- Zip file with Vitis project export

## Project Assignment 2: Audio Synthesizer

### Project Description:
In this project, you will build an audio synthesizer using the Pynq-Z2 board. The synthesizer should be capable of generating sounds based on input from push buttons, switches, or other input methods such as rotary encoders or audio input.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Input (push buttons and switches)  
- Sound effect(s) used  
- Output  

### Bonus Points:
- Bonus points can be earned by adding extra input features such as audio input or rotary encoders.
